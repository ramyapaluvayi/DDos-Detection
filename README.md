# DDos Detection

DDoS detection using Python involves monitoring network traffic for anomalies. A simple approach is to track the number of requests per IP; a sudden surge from one or multiple IPs may indicate a DDoS. Machine learning models (e.g., using random forest,xgBoost) can also classify normal vs. malicious traffic based on features like packet rate, size, and flags. Pythonâ€™s flexibility makes it ideal for real-time detection and logging suspicious activity for further analysis.
